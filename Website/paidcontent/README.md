Synopsis: This section of the project allows users access to the paid features
          of the website. 

Description: This part of the site allows users to use the tools that are, at
             the moment, provided to them with a paid subscription. It holds the formula generators, helpers, and other tools. Additionally, it also holds the download spots for the extensions for both chrome and for microsft excel

Issues:
 - When the submit button is clicked, the request is still undefined. Once 
   it is cliced again, then the request is built and the fetch call is sent to the server. This could be because state is being used.
